##  **BETTER APPROACH: Where to Actually Find Datasets**

## 

## **Option 1: TCGA (Still Good\!) \- Not GEO**

## **TCGA-BRCA (Breast Cancer) \- KEEP THIS ONE**

* Why it's different from GEO:  
  * Professionally curated by NCI  
  * Standardized clinical data  
  * Preprocessed options available  
  * Clear documentation  
  * Multiple download portals

Access Methods (NOT through GEO):

1. GDC Data Portal (Best for TCGA)  
   * Link: [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA)  
   * Clean interface, filtered downloads  
   * Clinical data standardized  
   * Can select specific files needed  
2. UCSC Xena Browser (Easiest)  
   * Link: [https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Breast%20Cancer%20(BRCA)](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Breast%20Cancer%20\(BRCA\))  
   * Pre-processed counts available  
   * Visualization tools included  
   * Metadata well-organized  
3. cBioPortal  
   * Link: [https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca\_tcga](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca_tcga)  
   * Clinical data easy to access  
   * Integrated with expression data

## **Option 2: What Professor Osier ACTUALLY Wants**

## **🔍 Look for These Instead:**

## **A. SRA BioProjects (Not Individual GEO Studies)**

Better search method: Find entire BioProject collections with:

* Complete study design documentation  
* Multiple experiments linked together  
* Clear sample groups  
* Published papers with methods

Example \- COVID-19 Dataset (Better Version):

* BioProject: PRJNA631753  
* Direct SRA Link: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA631753](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA631753)  
* Why better: All experiments grouped, clear study design, linked to publication  
* Paper: Published in Cell, complete methods  
* Metadata: Standardized across all samples

## 

## **B. Recount3 (Pre-Processed RNA-Seq Compendium)**

What it is: Pre-processed RNA-Seq data from SRA, ready to use  
Link: [https://rcount.bioconductor.org/](https://rcount.bioconductor.org/)  
Advantages:

* ✓ Already processed through a consistent pipeline  
* ✓ Quality metrics computed  
* ✓ Metadata extracted and standardized  
* ✓ Count matrices ready to download  
* ✓ Can start at differential expression immediately

How to search:

1. Go to [http://rcount.bioconductor.org/](http://rcount.bioconductor.org/)  
2. Search by organism or keyword  
3. Browse projects with 20+ samples  
4. Download processed count data \+ metadata

Example Recount3 Projects:

* GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) \- multiple tissues, 17,382 samples  
* TCGA (all cancer types)  
* SRA studies that have been reprocessed

## **C. ArrayExpress (European Alternative to GEO)**

Link: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress)  
Why it might be better:

* More standardized metadata requirements  
* Better quality control  
* Clearer experimental design annotations  
* Links to ENA (European Nucleotide Archive) for raw data

Search for: "RNA-seq" \+ "Homo sapiens" \+ your topic

## **D. GTEx Portal (Best for Human Tissue Expression)**

Link: [https://gtexportal.org/](https://gtexportal.org/)  
What it is: Multi-tissue gene expression reference from 948 donors  
Potential Projects:

* Compare gene expression across tissues (heart vs. liver vs. brain)  
* Sex differences in tissue expression (54 tissues × sex)  
* Age effects on gene expression  
* Population differences (ancestry data available for donors)

Advantages:

* ✓ Gold standard quality  
* ✓ Consistent processing  
* ✓ Rich metadata (age, sex, ancestry, ischemic time)  
* ✓ Easy download  
* ✓ Pre-computed statistics available

## **REVISED TOP 5 (Non-GEO Sources)**

## **\#1: TCGA Breast Cancer (via GDC Portal)**

* Source: [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA)

* Samples: Multiple studies aggregated, 20-50 samples each  
* Advantage: Pre-processed, count matrices ready  
* Why it works: Osier can verify quality before students start

## **5: Ask Professor Osier for Pre-Selected Options**

## **WHAT WECOULD DO (Optional):**

## **For Professor Osier :**

1. What data repositories do you recommend we use? TCGA? GTEx? Recount3? Specific BioProjects?  
2. Are there datasets you've used in previous years that worked well for this course?  
3. For our interests (COVID host response, cancer disparities, sleep deprivation, diabetes, sickle cell), which repositories would have suitable data with good metadata quality?"

## **Why This Approach Works:**

1. Addresses his concern  
2. Asks for guidance  
3. Still advocates for the group interests  
4. Positions us as thoughtful about data quality  
5. Opens the door for him to share pre-vetted datasets

## **Updated Strategy:**

## **Immediate (In Workshop):**

1. ✓ Get clarification on data sources he's used successfully

## **After Workshop:**

1. ✓ Explore TCGA/GTEx portals  
2. ✓ Find BioProjects (not GEO accessions) for your interests

## **Bottom Line:**

Professor Osier is right that GEO metadata is a disaster for teaching purposes.  
Your best move:

1. Ask for recommended repositories  
2. Check if he has pre-selected datasets  
3. Focus on professionally curated sources (TCGA, GTEx, Recount3, published BioProjects)

## **Dataset Validation Example: PRJNA717662 (Manual Steps)**

Below is a step-by-step guide to manually validate and filter a public SRA dataset (PRJNA717662) for class requirements. This process is fully transparent and reproducible by anyone with basic command-line skills.

### 

### **1\. Download the SRA RunInfo Table (CSV)**

* **Install Entrez Direct** (if not already):  
  * macOS: brew install entrez-direct  
  * Linux: see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/)  
* **Download the RunInfo CSV:**

```shell
cd /Users/pitergarcia/DataScience/Semester5/BIOL550/BIOL550-Lab/project_datasets
esearch -db sra -query "PRJNA717662" | efetch -format runinfo > PRJNA717662_runinfo.csv
```

### 

### **2\. Inspect and Filter the CSV**

* **Open the CSV** in Excel, Google Sheets, or with pandas/csvkit to explore columns:  
  * Run (SRR ID)  
  * LibraryLayout (should be PAIRED)  
  * avgLength (should be ≥300 for 2×150)  
  * spots (should be ≥40,000,000)  
  * ScientificName (should be Homo sapiens)  
* **Manual filtering:**  
  * Keep only rows where:  
    * LibraryLayout \= PAIRED  
    * avgLength ≥ 300  
    * spots ≥ 40,000,000  
    * ScientificName \= Homo sapiens  
  * Randomly select 20 SRR IDs from the filtered list for downstream analysis.  
* **Automated filtering (optional, for reproducibility):**  
  * Use the provided Python script:

```py
python filter_PRJNA717662_runinfo.py PRJNA717662_runinfo.csv PRJNA717662_20srrs.txt
```

  * This will output a text file with 20 qualifying SRR IDs.

### 

### **3\. Document Your Filtering**

* Save the filtered CSV or SRR list as evidence of your selection.  
* Note the exact criteria used (see above) and the date of download.

### 

### **4\. Next Steps**

* Use the resulting SRR list for FASTQ download and FastQC analysis as described in the rest of this document.

## **Writeup: SRA Dataset Selection & Evaluation**

### **1\. PRJNA717662 — Long-term Blood Transcriptome after SARS-CoV-2**

* **Project Accession:** [PRJNA717662](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA717662)  
* **Description:** This study profiles the blood transcriptome of 152 individuals at multiple time points after SARS-CoV-2 infection, using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (paired-end, 2×150 bp). *The goal is to understand long-term changes in immune and gene expression post-infection.*  
* **Sample Size:** 152 SRA runs (all human, paired-end).  
* **Read Depth:** Most samples have 40–70 million fragments (spots), with an average spot length of \~300 (2×150 bp). This meets the class requirement for depth and reading length.  
* **Case/Control:** The dataset includes both post-infection and control samples, with metadata indicating time since infection and clinical status.  
* **Strengths:**  
  * Large sample size and deep sequencing.  
  * Publicly available, no access restrictions.  
  * Well-annotated with clinical metadata.  
* **Weaknesses:**  
  * Some samples may have lower depth (\<40M), so filtering is needed.  
  * Case/control definitions may require careful review of metadata.  
    

### **2\. PRJNA292477 — TOPMed / Framingham Heart Study Transcriptome**

* **Project Accession:** [PRJNA292477](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA292477)  
* **Description:** This project is part of the NHLBI TOPMed program, profiling the transcriptome of Framingham Heart *Study participants to investigate genetic and environmental influences on cardiovascular health.*  
* **Sample Size:** Hundreds of samples (exact number depends on filtering).  
* **Read Depth:** Most samples have 40–75 million fragments, paired-end 2×150 bp reads.  
* **Case/Control:** The study includes a range of phenotypes (e.g., cardiovascular disease, controls), but some clinical metadata may be dbGaP-controlled.  
* **Strengths:**  
  * Large, well-characterized cohort with deep sequencing.  
  * Rich phenotype and longitudinal data.  
* **Weaknesses:**  
  * Some metadata is controlled-access (dbGaP), which may limit analysis.  
  * Requires careful selection of samples to match case/control definitions.

* **Terminology/interpretation fix (important):**  
  * In SRA RunInfo, **spots** are what you’ve been calling “fragments.” For paired-end data, a “spot” is typically a **read pair**.  
  * avgLength in RunInfo is the **average spot length** (sum across reads in the spot). So, avgLength ≈ 302 implies paired-end reads of roughly **2×151 bp**, not a physical DNA/RNA “fragment length” in the library-prep sense.

Change the two dataset summaries to report **spots** exactly as:

* PRJNA1017789: **40.1M–65.4M**  
* PRJNA1277581: **50.9M–173.3M**

Hey @Samuel Kopelev (slk1379) and @Nikhi Boggavarapu (nb6672) — would you be open to a quick 15-minute call tomorrow, **any time on/after 5 pm,** to reset and clear up misunderstandings?

My goal is to align on what happened and how we move forward. I’ll take responsibility for my part and briefly show my workspace so it’s clear what I meant (5 minutes). Then, you each can take the time to share anything I may have misunderstood, or that didn’t sit right (about 5 minutes each). If after that either of you still feels uncomfortable, that’s totally okay—we can be straightforward with the professor about it. 

If we can do this first, it’ll make our meeting with the professor more productive and focused on the next steps rather than confusion. If you’re not available after 5 pm, tell me a time that works, and I’ll try to adjust. If we can’t meet beforehand, we’ll address it when we meet with the professor.

Hi Dr. Osier,

For GSM794483\_C1\_R1\_STAR\_alignment.tgz, I used the NCBI/RefSeq D. melanogaster assembly GCF\_000001215.4 (FASTA+GTF from NCBI datasets) and built the STAR index from that matched pair. The paths on Sequoia were:

* FASTA: /home/pzg8794/refs/GCF\_000001215/ncbi\_dataset/data/GCF\_000001215.4/GCF\_000001215.4\_Release\_6\_plus\_ISO1\_MT\_genomic.fna  
* GTF: /home/pzg8794/refs/GCF\_000001215/ncbi\_dataset/data/GCF\_000001215.4/genomic.gtf  
* STAR \`--genomeDir\`: /home/pzg8794/star\_index/droso\_refseq\_ncbi

To make sure this wasn’t a reference/annotation naming issue, I also ran the same sample with the class BDGP6.84-style naming (a renamed FASTA to match 2L/2R/3L/3R/... \+ the BDGP6.84 GTF) and compared Log.final.out metrics; the alignment rates were essentially the same (99.20% vs 99.19% uniquely mapped). Based on that, I submitted the RefSeq-based BAM.

Best,    
Piter

Hi Dr. Osier,

Thanks for checking. 

For the submitted BAM ([GSM794483\_C1\_R1\_STAR\_alignment.tgz](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#)), I downloaded the reference from NCBI using the datasets tool (similar to how I’ve handled references in BIO630) and used the matched FASTA+GTF to build the STAR index and run alignment.

Reference \+ index paths on Sequoia:

* FASTA (RefSeq): [GCF\_000001215.4\_Release\_6\_plus\_ISO1\_MT\_genomic.fna](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#)  
* GTF (RefSeq): [genomic.gtf](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#)  
* STAR \--genomeDir: /home/pzg8794/star\_index/droso\_refseq\_ncbi

Quick steps I followed:

1. Download matched reference (FASTA+GTF) via NCBI datasets (GCF\_000001215.4).  
2. Build the STAR index with that FASTA+GTF.  
3. Align [GSM794483\_C1\_R1\_1.fq.gz](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#) \+ [GSM794483\_C1\_R1\_2.fq.gz](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#) with STAR using the same GTF.  
4. Submit [Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#) \+ [Log.final.out](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#).

At the beginning, I also tested the same sample using the BDGP6.84-style naming approach and compared [Log.final.out](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/pitergarcia/.vscode/extensions/openai.chatgpt-0.4.71-darwin-arm64/webview/#); the mapping rates were essentially the same (99.20% vs 99.19% uniquely mapped), so I proceeded with the RefSeq datasets reference since it was the cleanest/fastest to keep consistent.

If this looks “odd” on your end, is there a specific course-provided reference/version you want us to use for this assignment (or any additional STAR parameters you expect beyond those in the Trapnell analyses pdf?

Best,  
Piter

# Lab Notes

## Date Time: 2026-02-05 09:30:31

## 

## **Summary**

## This series of sessions covers a bioinformatics analysis workflow, focusing on the STAR aligner. The instructor, Mr. Garcia, begins by addressing housekeeping for the FastQC assignment, reminding students to zip and upload their HTML files for review. The main topic then shifts to the two-step process of using the STAR aligner: first, generating a genome index from a reference genome and annotation file, and second, aligning paired-end TruSeq sequencing reads to this index. Throughout the technical guidance, instructors emphasize server etiquette, including monitoring system load with the top command and managing long-running processes with nohup and the & operator to avoid overburdening shared resources. A key rule is to keep the server's load average below 15 when running resource-intensive tasks.

## The sessions also involve hands-on work and troubleshooting. Instructors guide students on debugging STAR aligner errors, such as "fatal input file error" or issues opening genome files, and clarify the difference between reportable programmatic errors (like memory allocation) and non-reportable user syntax errors for lab write-ups. They advise on how to manage runaway processes using kill \[PID\] and the importance of providing specific error messages and commands when seeking help. Due to software conflicts on the server (specifically with R), students are advised against using Cufflinks on the shared system. 

## **Knowledge Points**

### **1\. Assignment Administration and Support**

* ## **FastQC Assignment Submission:** Students must complete the FastQC assignment, zip all generated HTML files, and upload the single zip file. The instructor has already reviewed morning submissions, which were of high quality, and will post grades after feedback is addressed.

* ## **Lab Report Guidelines:** For lab write-ups, students should document commands, outputs, and programmatic errors encountered (e.g., memory issues with LimitGenomeGenerateRAM). Basic user errors like typos or incorrect file paths are not to be reported.

* ## **Troubleshooting and Communication:** When seeking help via email, students must provide the exact command line used and the full error message. Vague descriptions are insufficient. Office hours are available for more in-depth support. The instructor uses Slack for internal IT matters only, not for student communication.

### **2\. Server and Process Management**

* ## **Monitoring System Load:** Before running resource-intensive tasks, students must check the server's load using the top command (or htop). The load average should not exceed 15 when running STAR for the TruSeq dataset.

* ## **Understanding System Load:** System load is a composite measure of server business, including CPU usage and drive access. The server has two CPUs, each with 12 threads.

* ## **Managing Long-Running Processes:** Use nohup at the beginning of a command to prevent termination upon network disconnection. Use an ampersand (&) at the end to run the process in the background and regain terminal access. This is recommended for the genome mapping step.

* ## **Managing Runaway Processes:** A process can be terminated using its Process ID (PID) with the kill \[PID\] command. PIDs for running processes can be found using top.

### 

### 

### **3\. STAR Aligner Workflow**

* ## **Two-Step Process:** The analysis involves two main steps: 1\) generating a genome index (\--runMode genomeGenerate), and 2\) aligning sequencing reads to that index.

* ## **Step 1: Genome Index Generation:**

  * ## This step creates a map of the reference genome using a FASTA file and an annotation file (GTF/GFF).

  * ## **Parameters:**

    * ## \--runMode genomeGenerate: Specifies the task.

    * ## \--genomeDir: Defines the output directory for the index.

    * ## \--genomeFastaFiles: Specifies the reference genome FASTA file.

    * ## \--sjdbGTFfile: Specifies the annotation file.

    * ## \--limitGenomeGenerateRAM: Must be increased from the default value to use available memory.

* ## **Step 2: Read Alignment:**

  * ## This step aligns paired-end sequencing reads against the pre-built genome index.

  * ## **Parameters:**

    * ## \--genomeDir: Points to the directory containing the genome index.

    * ## \--runThreadN: Controls the number of threads. Use 4 if the server is not busy; reduce to 1 if the load is high.

    * ## \--readFilesIn: Specifies the input read files (forward and reverse, separated by a space).

    * ## \--sjdbGTFfile: The same annotation file from step 1 must be used.

  * ## **Paired-End Data:** The TruSeq data is paired-end (\_1 and \_2 files). Each pair (e.g., for one replicate) must be aligned together in a single STAR run. The experiment consists of two conditions (C1, C2) with three replicates each, resulting in six separate alignment runs. STAR uses paired-end information for quality filtering. Students need to find an additional parameter in the documentation for this.

### **4\. Software and Environment Notes**

* ## **Cufflinks and R:** Students are advised not to use Cufflinks for this analysis due to conflicting versions of R on the server. Those wishing to experiment with Cufflinks or R should do so on their local machines.

* ## **Trap Analysis:** The trap analysis must be performed on all available samples.

## **Assignments**

* ## Complete the FastQC analysis, combine HTML files into a single zip file, upload it, and review instructor feedback.

* ## Run the first step of the STAR analysis: genomeGenerate. Determine the correct reference genome and annotation file.

* ##  Use nohup and & to run the genome generation process in the background.

* ## Before running alignments, monitor server load with top. If the load average is near 15, wait or reduce thread count.

* ## For the trap analysis, run the analysis for all samples.

* ## Perform the second STAR step: align the paired-end reads for each sample individually (six total runs). Use a low thread count (e.g., 1\) initially.

* ## Search the STAR aligner documentation for the correct parameter for handling paired-end reads.

* ## Proceed to step three (rest of "trapdoor stuff") after completing the alignments.

* ## For the lab write-up, document commands, outputs, and any programmatic error messages encountered and how they were resolved.

* ## Students needing help should attend office hours (3:00 PM on Feb 5, 2026\) or email the instructor with exact commands and full error messages.

# **Clarification on Assignment Submissions and Course Policies**

## A student, who was unable to complete work due to illness, meets with a professor to clarify submission requirements for FastQC HTML files and a weekly report. The professor details the specific instructions for each assignment, explains the course's flexible submission policy, and confirms that the two tasks are separate deliverables.

## 

## **Initial Query and Justification for Delay**

## The student initiated the conversation to check in with the professor, explaining that they had been unable to finish their work the previous day. They had to go to bed early after experiencing chills and taking Tylenol. Before proceeding with the work, the student wanted to ask a clarifying question to ensure they understood the assignment's requirements and could provide the correct deliverables.

## 

## **Task 1: HTML File Submission Guidelines**

## The professor clarified the requirements for submitting the FastQC analysis files, correcting the student's initial assumption that a written interpretation of the findings was needed for this part of the assignment. The instruction is to take all the HTML files generated by FastQC from the travel data, compile them into a single zip file, and upload that file to the "My Courses" platform.

## 

## **Task 2: Weekly Report Details and Policies**

## The professor explained that a separate written report was due that morning before the workshop, a deadline the student had missed. However, the professor noted that the student could treat this as a "gimme week," as submissions are not required every single week. For future reports, the content should include one example of a command line used, followed by a prose description of factual observations from the data. This analysis should emphasize quantitative details, such as the number of spots or data ranges, and highlight any interesting or unusual findings.

## The professor referenced the syllabus, explaining the overall course structure for these reports. Of a total of 12 possible weekly reports (including one for project picks and an optional one during spring break), students are required to submit 10\. With 11 weeks remaining, the student needs to complete another nine reports, affording them some flexibility. The professor also recommended submitting assignments before the night they are due.

## 

## **Confirmation of Separate Deliverables**
