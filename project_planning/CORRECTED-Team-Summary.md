## 3-Phase Analysis Pipeline

**Phase 1 (Weeks 6-8):** Primary Analysis - QC, preprocessing, clean reads  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 10-11):** Secondary Analysis - Alignment/assembly + fairness audit  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 12-15):** Tertiary Analysis - DE analysis, visualizations, statistical rigor  
**Bonus (Weeks 15-16):** Optional SNP calling, network analysis, ML classification
