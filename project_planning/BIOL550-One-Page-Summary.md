## Analysis Framework: 3-Phase Pipeline

```
PHASE 1 (Weeks 6-8): Primary Stage Analysis
├─ Lead: Member 1 (Computational)
├─ Tasks: FastQC QC, quality trimming, contamination filtering
└─ Output: Clean, high-quality reads

PHASE 2 (Weeks 10-11): Secondary Stage Analysis
├─ Lead: Member 1 (Computational) + Member 2 (Fairness Audit)
├─ Tasks: Bowtie2/TopHat alignment, BAM generation, disparate impact analysis
└─ Output: Aligned reads (BAM files), fairness audit report

PHASE 3 (Weeks 12-15): Tertiary Stage Analysis
├─ Lead: Member 2 (Statistical)
├─ Tasks: Differential expression, statistical analysis, fairness metrics in DE
└─ Output: DE results with statistical support, visualizations

BONUS (Weeks 15-16): Extended Analyses
├─ Lead: Distributed by expertise
├─ Options: SNP calling, isoform analysis, co-expression networks, ML classification
