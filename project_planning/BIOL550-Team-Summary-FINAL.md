## 3-Phase Analysis Pipeline

**Phase 1 (Weeks 6-8):** Primary Analysis - FastQC, quality trimming, adapter/contamination filtering, clean reads  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 10-11):** Secondary Analysis - Bowtie2/TopHat alignment, BAM files + fairness audit (disparate impact)  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 12-15):** Tertiary Analysis - Differential expression, statistical rigor, visualizations, fairness metrics in DE results  
**Bonus (Weeks 15-16):** Optional - SNP calling, isoform analysis, network analysis, machine learning classification  

---

## Key Responsibilities

**Samuel (Computational):** FastQC, CutAdapt/FastX quality trimming, Bowtie2/TopHat alignment, BAM file generation, GitHub repo management, reproducible pipeline documentation

**Piter (Statistical - YOU):** Differential expression quantification (Cufflinks/RSEM), statistical tests (FDR, Bonferroni), fairness metrics (disparate impact, equalized odds), publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, heatmaps, boxplots)

**Claire (Biological):** Literature review (15+ primary sources), pathway analysis, biological interpretation, functional enrichment, Introduction/Discussion writing, connecting DE results to biological significance

**Nikhi (Support):** Data organization and metadata management, literature compilation, coordination support, meeting notes and decision log tracking
