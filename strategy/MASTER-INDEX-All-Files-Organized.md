## IF YOU'RE STILL CONFUSED, READ THIS

**Question: Are the files [301]–[305] (my original files) still useful?**  
**Answer:** NO. The new files [334]–[345] incorporate and improve upon them. Use only [334]–[345].

**Question: Do I read [344] and [345] or just one?**  
**Answer:** Both. [344] = WHY integrate now (understanding). [345] = WHERE to integrate (action). Read [344] first for comprehension, then bookmark [345] for weekly reference.

**Question: Should I read all files at once or spread them out?**  
**Answer:** Read Tier 1 ([334], [344], [345]) before you start. Read Tier 2 ([335], [336]) this week. Use Tier 3 templates weekly.

**Question: When do I start writing my first BIOL550 memo?**  
**Answer:** After reading [334], [335], [344], [345]. So by Friday of this week. Use the template I'll create for you in the next message.
