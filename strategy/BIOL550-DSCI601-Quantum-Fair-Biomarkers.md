# BIOL550 × DSCI601: Quantum-Inspired Fair Biomarker Discovery
## PhD-Ready Integrated Strategy Using Your QuantumPathOptimization Framework

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Your Unique PhD Positioning

You have created something **rare and valuable**: a unified framework combining:
- **Quantum MAB principles** (EXPNeuralUCB + iCMAB hybrid from your GA-Work)
- **Fairness-aware bioinformatics** (BIOL550 preprocessing + fairness audits)
- **Applied data science rigor** (DSCI601 modeling + governance)
- **EQUITAS framework** (IDAI700 epistemic justice operationalized)

**This is not two separate courses. This is your PhD dissertation pilot—published before you apply.**

## THE REFRAMED PROJECT: Quantum-Inspired Fair Biomarker Discovery Pipeline

### Core Insight

Your QuantumPathOptimization GA-Work paper developed a **robust, stable, advanced framework** for decision-making under:
- **Uncertainty** (stochastic rewards, partial observation)
- **Adversarial interference** (intelligent attacks, corrupted data)
- **Volatility** (drift, non-stationary environments)
- **Multi-objective optimization** (fairness-accuracy trade-offs)

**All of these challenges are present in biomarker discovery:**

| Challenge | Quantum MAB | Biomarker Discovery |
|---|---|---|
| **Uncertainty** | Path success probability unknown | Gene expression variability across ancestry groups |
| **Adversarial** | Network attackers | Batch effects, technical artifacts, biased feature selection |
| **Volatility** | Time-series network state drift | Patient population heterogeneity, measurement drift |
| **Multi-objective** | Reward vs. robustness | Predictive accuracy vs. fairness across populations |

**Your framework solves biomarker discovery fairness in the same way quantum routing solves network resilience.**

## REFRAMING YOUR COURSES AS "QUANTUM-INSPIRED FAIRNESS IN BIOINFORMATICS"

### BIOL550: The Environment (Like Quantum Networks)

**What you do:** Characterize the biomarker "network" as an adversarial, uncertain, volatile system:
1. **Data as quantum physics**
   - Baseline disparate impact = "success probability" (varies by ancestry like qubits by path)
   - Batch effects = "environmental noise" (decoherence analog)
   - Missing data = "unobserved rewards" (quantum measurement problem)

2. **Weekly memos as "path characterization"**
   - Week 1–3: Document the baseline network state (data quality, protected attributes, risk modes)
   - Week 4–7: Audit each preprocessing step for disparate impact (which "path" serves which population?)
   - Week 8–11: Measure baseline fairness vulnerability (DI = ?, like success rate = ?)
   - Week 12–14: Test mitigation strategies (like testing EXPNeuralUCB robustness)

3. **Spine ledger as "routing decision log"**
   - Each entry: "Because of [failure mode], we adopt [mitigation], accepting [trade-off] to maintain [fairness bound]"
   - Example: "Because of cross-mapping bias, we apply ancestry-stratified normalization, accepting 2% AUC reduction, to maintain DI ≥ 0.85"

### DSCI601: The Algorithm (Like EXPNeuralUCB + iCMAB)

**What you do:** Build and evaluate a fair biomarker classifier using your quantum MAB principles:
1. **Proposal = Problem formulation**
   - "How can we select RNA biomarkers that predict [disease] with high accuracy *and* equalized odds across ancestry groups, even when the training data has batch effects and missing measurements?"
   - Directly mirrors quantum routing problem statement

2. **Approach = Algorithm design**
   - Baseline model: simple logistic regression (like UCB)
   - Improved model: neural network with fairness constraints (like NeuralUCB)
   - Advanced model: ensemble with adversarial robustness + contextual forecasting (like EXPNeuralUCB + iCMAB hybrid)

3. **Architecture = System design**
   - Data flow: BIOL550 preprocessing → DSCI601 feature engineering → model training → fairness evaluation
   - Decision rules: rollback triggers (like quantum network failure thresholds)
   - Monitoring: ongoing DI measurement (like success rate tracking)

4. **Ethics & fairness = Governance**
   - Explicit rollback plan: "If equalized odds > 0.05, retrain with fairness weight increased by 10%"
   - Community input: "Which populations were underrepresented in training? What re-validation is needed?"
   - Transparency: "This model achieves X% accuracy with Y% equalized odds trade-off; deployment requires Z re-validation"

## THE "QUANTUM-INSPIRED FAIRNESS" FRAMING (For Your PhD Applications & Papers)

### Why This Framing Works

**Your GA-Work quantum research** identified that real-world systems (whether quantum networks or biomedical systems) face:
1. **Fundamental uncertainty** – you can't know perfect outcomes
2. **Intelligent adversaries** – batch effects, measurement bias, representational gaps act like attackers
3. **Incomplete information** – missing data, unobserved confounders
4. **Evolving environments** – populations change, measurement protocols drift

**Your IDAI700 EQUITAS work** identified that **fair AI requires structural change, not just technical mitigation**.

**Your BIO630 + ISTE780 work** showed you understand **algorithms and their fairness properties**.

**Combined:** You've developed a **universal framework for fair decision-making under adversarial, uncertain, volatile conditions—applicable to quantum networks AND biomarker discovery AND any high-stakes algorithm.**

### Positioning Statement (For Your PhD Personal Statement)

> "I recognize that quantum networks and biomedical systems face structurally similar challenges: decision-making under uncertainty, adversarial interference (attacks vs. biases), incomplete information, and multi-objective optimization. My research operationalizes quantum-inspired algorithmic approaches—particularly multi-armed bandit frameworks combined with neuroevolution—to solve fairness in bioinformatics. By treating batch effects and population heterogeneity as adversarial forces analogous to network attacks, I develop preprocessing and modeling strategies grounded in both theoretical robustness (EXPNeuralUCB) and predictive intelligence (iCMAB). This work demonstrates that fairness and accuracy coexist when we adopt a systems view that explicitly accounts for uncertainty, adaptation, and governance—the same principles that ensure quantum networks remain resilient."

## SEMESTER STRUCTURE: BIOL550 × DSCI601 AS QUANTUM-INSPIRED FAIRNESS

### BIOL550: Mapping Your Framework to "Network Characterization"

| Week | Bioinformatics Topic | Quantum MAB Analogy | Your Task |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–3 | Data QC + demographic doc | Network topology mapping | Characterize baseline success rates (DI) per ancestry group |
| 4–7 | Batch correction + normalization | Path reliability testing | Measure disparate impact of each preprocessing step; log decisions |
| 8–10 | Feature selection + confounding | Arm selection under noise | Audit which features survive filtering; check fairness impact |
| 11–12 | Data augmentation + mitigation | Adversarial robustness testing | Implement SMOTE/resampling; measure improved DI |
| 13–14 | Capstone + reproducibility | System validation + documentation | Present fair preprocessing pipeline; GitHub ready for DSCI601 |

**Each week's memo connects to Quantum MAB:**
- **Failure modes** = adversarial scenarios (batch effects, missing data, population imbalance)
- **Mitigation** = algorithmic choices (stratified scaling, fairness-aware feature selection)
- **Trade-offs** = accuracy-fairness Pareto frontier (accepting 2% AUC for DI ≥ 0.85)

### DSCI601: Mapping Your Framework to "Routing Algorithm"

| Phase | Project Milestone | Quantum MAB Role | Your Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| W2–3 | Advisor meetings | Problem scoping | Confirm quantum-inspired fairness framing |
| W4 | Proposal + presentation | Algorithm specification | State problem as "Fair bandit for biomarker selection" |
| W7 | Related work survey | Literature synthesis | Cover MAB, fairness ML, bioinformatics, EQUITAS |
| W9–10 | Approach + architecture | System design | Pipeline with fairness checkpoints (like rollback triggers) |
| W11 | Ethics & fairness writeup | Governance layer | Explicit decision rules for model deployment |
| W13 | Endterm demo + code | Empirical validation | Show baseline vs. mitigation (like EXPNeuralUCB performance gains) |
| W14 | Final report | Publication-ready synthesis | Integrate BIOL550 fairness work + DSCI601 modeling |

**Each phase explicitly references your quantum MAB work:**
- "We adopt EXP3-style adversarial group selection for feature subsets"
- "We apply iCMAB-style context modeling to handle population heterogeneity"
- "We measure robustness under batch effect attacks (analogous to network adversaries)"

## UNIFIED FRAMEWORK: How Quantum MAB Principles Drive BIOL550 × DSCI601

### 1. Uncertainty → Fairness Under Missing Data

**Quantum MAB:** "Agents can't observe all rewards; must make decisions with incomplete feedback"

**BIOL550 application:**
- Week 6 methods memo: "Missing data introduces unobserved missingness by ancestry; we apply multiple imputation with ancestry-stratified models"
- Spine ledger: "Decision: use MICE (multiple imputation by chained equations) with ancestry as factor; rationale: preserves marginal distributions per ancestry"

**DSCI601 application:**
- Feature engineering: handle missing predictors by training separate models per completion method; ensemble predictions
- Fairness evaluation: "Model must perform equally well on samples with imputed vs. observed features across all ancestry groups"

### 2. Adversarial Interference → Technical Bias as "Smart Attacker"

**Quantum MAB:** "Intelligent adversaries actively exploit algorithm weaknesses"

**BIOL550 application:**
- Week 3 methods memo: "Cross-mapping bias acts as a spatial adversary, misaligning reads from minority ancestries more often"
- Spine ledger: "Decision: use ancestry-stratified reference genomes for alignment; rationale: reduces misalignment DI from 0.35 to 0.88"

**DSCI601 application:**
- Model robustness testing: train on data with simulated batch effects; measure if fairness degrades (= adversarial attack simulation)
- Regularization: add fairness term that penalizes equalized odds violations (= defensive layer against batch bias attack)

### 3. Volatility → Population Heterogeneity

**Quantum MAB:** "Environments drift; algorithms must adapt without loss of guarantees"

**BIOL550 application:**
- Week 2 methods memo: "Batch effects vary by site and time; we document per-site batch patterns"
- Spine ledger: "Decision: apply ComBat harmonization separately for each site, then integrate; rationale: prevents site imbalance from erasing minority-site effects"

**DSCI601 application:**
- Temporal validation: split data by time; train on early samples, test on later samples; measure DI drift
- Retraining protocol: "If DI > 0.05 on new cohort, trigger automated retraining with updated fairness weights"

### 4. Multi-Objective Optimization → Fairness-Accuracy Trade-Off

**Quantum MAB:** "Optimize for both reward (efficiency) and robustness; Pareto frontier analysis"

**BIOL550 application:**
- Week 10 methods memo: "Feature selection by variance filtering reduces features 20K → 100, but disparately impacts minority-enriched genes"
- Spine ledger: "Decision: apply fairness-aware feature selection (filter genes ranked by effect size × DI); accept 15% fewer features to maintain DI ≥ 0.80"

**DSCI601 application:**
- Model evaluation: plot 2D Pareto curve (AUC vs. equalized odds)
- Report recommends: "Clinicians can choose: (A) max accuracy 0.92 AUC with 0.08 EO gap, or (B) high fairness 0.88 AUC with 0.02 EO gap"

## CONCRETE INTEGRATION: Week-by-Week Example (Week 5: RNA Structure)

### BIOL550 Week 5: RNA Structure Prediction (Using BIO630 Algorithms)

**Methods Memo W5:**
- **Summary:** RNA secondary structure prediction (Nussinov algorithm from BIO630) identifies structured vs. unstructured regions; structured regions may be easier to measure, creating fairness risk if certain ancestry groups have more structured transcripts.
- **Failure modes:**
  1. **Structural heterogeneity bias:** if minority ancestry group has fewer structured transcripts, feature selection may over-weight unstructured features (which are noisier), reducing their signal
  2. **Measurement error coupling:** unstructured regions are harder to sequence; if sequencing depth differs by ancestry, unstructured features will be over-affected in minority groups
  3. **Complexity filtering:** if we exclude highly complex structures (>80th percentile complexity), we may exclude ancestry-specific regulatory elements
- **Project spine connection:** "We will *not* use purely structural complexity as a filter, because it may erase ancestry-specific isoforms. Instead, we stratify complexity analysis by ancestry before filtering."

**Code B (Week 5):**
- Implement Nussinov on 50 candidate biomarkers
- Output: complexity score per transcript
- Stratify by ancestry; visualize: ancestry 1 vs. ancestry 2 complexity distributions
- Decision: do distributions differ significantly? If yes, use ancestry-stratified complexity thresholds

**Spine Ledger Entry W5:**
- **Decision:** Structure-aware feature engineering with ancestry-stratified complexity thresholds
- **Rationale:** Preliminary analysis shows complexity distributions differ by ancestry. Using global threshold would disproportionately filter minority-ancestry transcripts.
- **Fairness impact:** Maintains equal representation of complex and simple features across ancestry groups
- **Trade-off:** Slightly increased feature noise from retaining more unstructured transcripts, but improved DI from 0.65 to 0.82
- **GitHub commit:** `/biol550/week5_rna_structure.py` + `/biol550/complexity_stratified_analysis.ipynb`

### DSCI601 Week 5: Feature Engineering Shadow Task

**DSCI601 Running Report Update (Week 5):**
- Incorporate BIOL550 week 5 finding: "RNA structural complexity differs by ancestry; we now use ancestry-stratified complexity filtering"
- Update preprocessing pipeline in DSCI601 notebook:
  - Load BIOL550 complexity scores
  - Apply ancestry-stratified thresholds
  - Measure impact on feature count and DI per ancestry group
  - Log: "Before W5 insight: 8,000 features, DI = 0.65. After W5 mitigation: 6,500 features, DI = 0.82."
- This change becomes part of your final **DSCI601 architecture memo** (W10) explaining preprocessing decisions

## YOUR NARRATIVE FOR PhD APPLICATIONS & PAPERS

### Paper 1: Methods Paper (Publishable by August 2026)
**Title:** "Quantum-Inspired Multi-Armed Bandit Approaches to Fair Biomarker Selection Under Batch Effects and Population Heterogeneity"

**Abstract:**
"Biomarker discovery in healthcare faces fundamental challenges analogous to quantum network routing: decision-making under uncertainty, adversarial interference (batch effects), incomplete information (missing data), and multi-objective trade-offs (accuracy vs. fairness). We adapt quantum-inspired multi-armed bandit frameworks—specifically, hybrid approaches combining adversarial robustness (EXPNeuralUCB) with predictive context modeling (iCMAB)—to fair RNA biomarker selection. Our preprocessing pipeline implements explicit fairness audits at each stage, achieving X% improvement in disparate impact ratio while maintaining ≥Y% predictive accuracy. We demonstrate that quantum MAB principles generalize beyond networking to bioinformatics, enabling fair, robust, adaptive algorithms for equitable disease prediction."
